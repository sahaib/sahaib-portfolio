description: A raw and honest kickoff to InsideTheStack — a series for builders who operate across systems, stacks, tools, and chaos instead of staying inside one box.

## Introduction

**InsideTheStack** is a series for builders who don’t fit inside one box.

For the people who learn everything, break things, fix things, automate things, integrate systems, and grow through every messy experience. For the ones who refuse to be limited by a title, a stack, or a “defined role”.

This is not a traditional series.  
It’s a mindset.

## Why I’m doing this

For years, I worked in environments where you don’t get a single job description.

You don’t get “your role”.  
You get:

- whatever breaks  
- whatever users complain about  
- whatever the product needs  
- whatever the logs whisper  
- whatever infra can’t handle  
- whatever systems don’t talk to each other  
- whatever people avoid because it’s too complex  

I didn’t learn across stacks because I wanted to look smart.  
I learned because **I had no choice**.

Along the way, I picked up:

- AI systems  
- Data engineering  
- Support engineering  
- Automation frameworks  
- Cloud platforms  
- Observability tools  
- Security practices  
- Internal tools  
- System design  
- Analytics  
- Integrations  
- And an unreasonable number of tools, services, APIs and workflows  

And the truth?

**I still know very little.**  
There is too much to uncover.  
That’s exactly what keeps me excited.

## What InsideTheStack really is

InsideTheStack is not:

- another tutorial series  
- a “top 10 tools for 2025” list  
- motivational fluff  

It’s a **practical playbook** from someone who learned everything the hard way — by:

- taking responsibility without permission  
- building tools because no one else would  
- automating tasks because time was running out  
- connecting systems that were never meant to connect  
- fixing problems at 2 AM  
- reading logs like novels  
- surviving architecture mistakes  
- working around bad infrastructure  
- learning AI before it was mainstream  
- using tools before docs existed  
- finding solutions when no one had answers  

This series is for people who operate at that wavelength.

## What I’ll be sharing

Across **32 topics**, I’ll break down the systems, tools and concepts that shaped me.

### **AI and LLM Engineering**
- tokenization  
- KV cache  
- local vs cloud AI  
- Claude 4.5 and why it’s the first true “software engineering model”  
- coding neutralisation  
- RAG systems  
- picking the right model  
- building AI products as a solo builder  

### **Data and Observability**
- BigQuery  
- Databricks  
- Metabase / Retool / Data Studio  
- Sentry and Grafana  
- Mixpanel and funnel reality  
- IP intelligence  
- anomaly detection  

### **Automation and Internal Tools**
- Power Automate  
- Copilot Studio  
- Amazon Q  
- Freshdesk custom apps  
- Retool internal tools  
- CRM automation  

### **System Design**
- WhatsApp 0.1s messaging  
- Uber’s H3 grid  
- Cloudflare’s DDoS systems  
- Notion’s local-first architecture  

### **Security and Preventive Engineering**
- early-stage access traps  
- preventive architecture  
- monitoring stacks  
- threat patterns  
- traffic analysis

## The promise

I’m not here to act like I know everything.  
I’m not here to lecture.  
I’m not here to pretend to be an expert.

I’m here to:

- share what I learned  
- share what broke  
- share what worked  
- share what I wish someone told me  
- share what I’m still figuring out  
- share what I’m experimenting with  
- share what’s changing in tech every month  
- share how I’m staying relevant by learning across stacks  

This is my stack — built from curiosity, pressure, mistakes, late nights, broken systems, small wins, big wins and constant learning.

If you connect with this energy…  
If you hate being boxed into one skill…  
If you jump across domains…  
If you love systems more than titles…

Then **InsideTheStack is for you**.

## Where this goes next

I’ll be sharing:

- raw breakdowns  
- deep dives  
- architecture diagrams  
- real examples  
- decision frameworks  
- lessons from failure  
- things I learned while solving problems no one else touched  
- things I’m learning right now  

This isn’t a one-way series.  
It’s a journey I’m making public.

---

## The mindset behind it all

If one belief defines the entire series, it’s this:

**Being a builder today means being multi-stack.**  
AI won’t reward narrow specialists.  
AI will reward people who understand systems, patterns and connections.

I’m still at the beginning — still learning every day, still uncovering more layers of tech.

InsideTheStack is simply me sharing the path.

## Welcome to InsideTheStack

Let’s learn, break, build, fix, automate, observe, ship, secure and grow — together.

This is just the start.
