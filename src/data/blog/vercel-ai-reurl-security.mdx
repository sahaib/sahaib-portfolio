## Introduction

I’m an AI-assisted developer, not a traditional engineer. I learn as I build. And reurl.dev — my free, fast, analytics-powered URL shortener — is one of the projects I’m most proud of.

On **March 3, 2025**, just two days before my Product Hunt launch, reurl.dev was hit with thousands of **401 Unauthorized** requests. The traffic was clearly malicious and intense enough to threaten uptime, analytics accuracy and user experience.

I had to act fast.

This is how **Vercel** and **AI tools like Cursor** helped me detect the issue, block the attack, secure my endpoints and get reurl.dev stable again — all within minutes.

---

## The problem: a flood of unauthorized access

While preparing updates for the BIP 3.0 community, my Vercel dashboard started showing unusual numbers:

- **34.9K total requests**
- **28.8K denied**
- **429 challenged**
- Spikes of **1.5K requests per minute**

Almost all of them were unauthorized hits.

As someone still learning backend security, this was overwhelming. But reurl.dev is my answer to overpriced and limited link tools, so seeing it under attack days before launch felt personal.

---

## Step 1: Vercel Attack Challenge Mode bought me time

The first lifesaver was **Vercel Firewall**.

I enabled **Attack Challenge Mode** which immediately began:

- Challenging suspicious traffic  
- Denying abusive patterns  
- Allowing legitimate users through  
- Showing real-time spikes and behavior  

This gave me space to breathe and analyze instead of panicking. For someone still learning, this kind of platform support is priceless.

Vercel’s automatic filtering handled the heavy load while I prepared the actual fix.

---

## Step 2: AI-generated middleware with Cursor IDE

Once the attack was contained, I needed to stop the **401 spam** for good.  
So I opened Cursor IDE and wrote something simple:

> “Update my middleware to block IPs that cause repeated unauthorized access attempts and stop 401 errors.”

Within seconds, Cursor produced a middleware script integrating **Redis** to:

### 1. Apply rate limiting  
Limit each IP to **10 requests/minute** and block excess with a 429.

### 2. Track unauthorized IPs  
Record source IPs for every failed or suspicious hit.

### 3. Dynamically block bad actors  
Move abusive IPs to a blacklist and return a **403 Forbidden** instantly.

I deployed the middleware to Vercel and watched the logs refresh:

- 401 errors: **Stopped**
- Traffic: Stabilized
- Only legitimate requests continued flowing

The feeling was unreal. AI helped me build and deploy a “senior-level” fix in minutes.

## Step 3: Using Vercel Speed Insights to validate performance

After stabilizing security, I wanted to ensure performance hadn’t tanked.

Vercel’s **Speed Insights** showed:

- Real Experience Score: **95 (P95)**
- A warning to install the latest `@vercel/speed-insights` package

I updated it:

```bash
npm i @vercel/speed-insights

Added:

<SpeedInsights />
```

And redeployed.

Within 30 minutes, real data appeared again, confirming that reurl.dev was performing at full speed.

⸻

### Outcome: attack blocked, stability restored, lessons learned

The full recovery took under 15 minutes:
	•	Vercel blocked the surge
	•	Attack Challenge Mode filtered the worst traffic
	•	AI-generated middleware cut 401s to zero
	•	Speed Insights confirmed no performance drop

As an AI-assisted developer, this incident taught me that I don’t need to know everything — I need the right stack, the right tools, and the willingness to respond fast.

⸻

### Next steps for reurl.dev

Here’s what I’m implementing next:

1. Persistent IP blocking

Storing blocked IPs in Redis with longer TTLs.

2. Preventive measures

Introducing reCAPTCHA or equivalent protection on sensitive routes.

3. Improved monitoring

Alerts and dashboards to notify me of unusual activity immediately.

4. Sharing the journey

Posting this on X and BIP 3.0 to inspire others building in public.

⸻

### Final thoughts

I’m still learning, but modern tools like Vercel and Cursor IDE make professional-grade security accessible to people like me.

This experience turned a scary moment into a breakthrough. If you’re learning security or backend development, remember:

You don’t have to know everything.
You have to be willing to adapt, respond and use the right tools.

Try reurl.dev, support the project if you like, and let’s build a safer internet together — one small, meaningful improvement at a time.
