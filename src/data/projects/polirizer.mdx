- **Emoji Indicators:** Visually enhances summaries with emojis for clarity.  
- **Dark Mode:** A dark theme for comfortable reading.  
- **Settings Modal:** Manage API keys and extension options.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Extension Framework:** React.js with TypeScript for UI.  
- **AI Models:** Integrates OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and Anthropic Claude via REST APIs.  
- **Authentication:** Token-based API key management.  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for UI components.  
- **Storage:** LocalStorage for user settings and limited free usage.
